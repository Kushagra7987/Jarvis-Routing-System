# Jarvis Routing System

## Overview

The **Jarvis Routing System** project aims to address critical challenges in logistics and transportation by developing a Dynamic Route Optimization System. The system leverages real-time data from multiple APIs to optimize delivery routes, estimate vehicle emissions, and promote environmental sustainability.

## Features

- **Route Optimization**: Calculates the best routes based on current traffic conditions.
- **Traffic Incident Reporting**: Displays real-time traffic incidents along the route.
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Provides air quality information for both the origin and destination locations.
- **Emission Calculations**: Estimates CO2 emissions based on the distance traveled and vehicle fuel efficiency.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Python**: For core logic, API integrations, and emissions calculations.

 
  - ðŸ“¡ APIs Used

Google Maps API: For route generation and distance calculations.
TomTom API: For real-time traffic incident data.
AQICN API: For air quality data.
OSRM: For alternative route optimization (future integration).
